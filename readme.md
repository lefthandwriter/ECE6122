# ECE6122 Advanced Programming Techniques (C++)

These are a few projects that I did during the Fall 2016 iteration of this course, taught by Prof George Riley.

## Projects
1. 2D DFT of an image using message passing interface (MPI) - 'fft2d.cc'
2. 2D DFT of an image using pthreads - 'threadDFT2d.cc'
3. Drawing the Mandelbrot Set with OpenGL, utilizing pthreads - 'MBSet.cc'
