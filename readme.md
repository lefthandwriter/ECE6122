# ECE6122 Advanced Programming Techniques (C++)

These are a few projects that I did during the Fall 2016 iteration of this course, taught by Prof George Riley.

## Projects
1. 2D DFT of an image using message passing interface (MPI).
2. 2D DFT of an image using pthreads.
3. Drawing the Mandelbrot Set with OpenGL, utilizing pthreads.
